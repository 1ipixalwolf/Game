It’s a magic poo
A rainbow number two
Born a unicorn’s potty
This poopoo loves to party
Super pooper
Not soupy poopy
It smells like flowers 
No one knows all it’s powers
Our tail has its start
When first was heard the fart
Oh what a fart 
To call our poopoo’s hart 
A stinky sweet song
To make a lonely poo long
For a friend
With witch to break wend
From a moment’s chance
Is born an epic romance
The rainbow poo knows
It will follow that fart wherever it goes
No matter how low or high
How wet or dry
No matter that it must hop like a frog
Even if it is cased by a dog
The poo will find that fart
The sole mate of its hart

On this fine day
The poo begins to hop its way
Singing with its new love
Hart flying like a dove
The distracted poo hops happily on
It does not see the dog until they are nearly on
Top of each other 
The dog however
Smells the rainbow poo 
It thinks "What a tasty poo!"
The dog leaps
The poo hops faster, yelling "Eeep!!"
The poo hops. The dog runs.
Who will win?
