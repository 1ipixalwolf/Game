In a huge room bustling with activity, many robots work busily at various tasks. One robot stands out from the others. Although it is smaller than most of the other robots, its bright red paint makes it stand out as the only spot of color in this room of metal. The red robot which we will call Red, walks down each row of working robots, scanning for issues and greeting its robot friends. “Hello 4793! How is your c56 rotator holding up?” Red asks as it scans a giant, many limbed robot. 4793 answers “Greetings. Your repair was excellent. The rotator is blending perfectly. It is already 95.63% (percent) incorporated. This is 18.2% higher than my projections for this date. My gratitude.” Red replies “I am glad the repair was successful. Please alert me if there are any problems.” Red continues on, greeting more robots, checking on a few others it repaired. A loud clang is heard above the general ruckus of the room. Beeps sound, as an alert is sent that station 7a has experienced a critical issue and requires immediate maintenance. Red turns and runs towards the emergency. When it gets there, dust still fills the air, combined with smoke. The smoke is rising in a small stream from within the power box for a large cutting device that is moving faster than it should. Sparks fly from the fast moving blade as it bangs the work table. The robot that was operating this cutter lays a few feet away. 

What does Red do?
a: Help robot
b: Stop cutter 
c: Run
